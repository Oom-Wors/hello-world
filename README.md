The First Of A Lot

College drop-out who has been working as a Remote Point of Sale Support Technician, as well as an Onsite Technician for Arch Retail Systems for two years, before moving to wiGroup, where I am currently working as a Service Desk Agent.
My goal is to learn Web Dev, and climb the career ladder.
